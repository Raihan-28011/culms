# CULMS - Learning Management System for University of Chittagong

CULMS is a computerized system used to enroll students in virtual courses,
host quizzes, assign assignments, and create lessons.

# Purpose of Project

The purpose of this project is to develop an application that handles data
using a database and applies the theories, methodologies, tools, and tech-
nologies that we learned in our database courses, CSE413 and CSE414.

# Background and Motivation

During the pandemic, teachers struggled to teach their courses to students
without a proper teaching environment. Students also wasted their time
because they lacked proper guidance. It was difficult for our teachers to
grade studentsâ€™ work, take exams, and create new lesson plans on time. We
knew that we had to come up with a better way of managing this process
than what was currently being used. Since our teachers and students needed
structure and guidance that their current platform could not provide, we
created the software program CULMS to meet these needs.
